### Our chatbot project aims to create a basic conversational interface where users can interact with the chatbot by sending text messages. 
### The chatbot will use the GPT-2 model to generate responses based on the input provided by the user, allowing for dynamic and contextually relevant interactions. 
### User will simply put input and model will try to predict the next words of the sentence.

### We are not making use of high level resources like GPUs, instead we are implementing it in our CPU environment. 
### We need Python, Flask and HuggingFace LLM model with Transformer library.

## From Transformers, we are using two modules such as GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2LMHeadModel.
